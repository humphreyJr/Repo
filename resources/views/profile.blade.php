						<h2>About</h2> 
						<hr />
						<p>
							SlashMyFees was started by people like you! As business owners we’ve dealt with multiple processors only to find out how difficult that can be. A few months after signing most of them would raise the rates without letting us know. The credit card statements are difficult to read. We have vetted our partners to ensure you get the lowest rates, so that you can focus more on your business.	
						</p>
						<p>
							We promise and guarantee that you will get the lowest rate. We are a small company with honesty and growth at our core bringing transparency to this industry. We also believe that good business isn’t only about profit; it’s about giving back to the world we live in. For this reason, we give back 10% of our earnings to charities that make a difference for today and for the future.
