						  <p class="text-left" style="padding-top: 10px;">Merchant services is a broad term that is used to define a wide range of payment processing options. Most automatically associate merchant services with debit and credit card processing, but there is a wide variety of other options encompassed in its broader definition.</p>


						  <h1 class="text-left" style="color: #3baabd; padding-top: 20px; text-decoration: underline;">Merchant Services</h1>
						  <p class="text-left" style="padding-top: 10px;">Merchant services are the generic name given worldwide to a broad category of financial services intended for use by businesses. In its most specific use, it usually refers to the service that enables a business to accept a bank card transaction payment through some secure (encrypted) channel by use of the customer's credit card or debit card or NFC/RFID-enabled device. However, the term can include all of the following in its use:</p>

						  <p class="text-left" style="padding-top: 10px;"> 
							<ul class="text-left">
								<li>
									Credit and debit cards payment processing: the most common type of merchant services, they allow the merchants to accept bank cards as a form of payment
								</li>	
								<li>
									Check guarantee and check conversion services: these service allow the merchants to accept checks with reduced liability against fraud
								</li>
								<li>
									Automated Clearing House (ACH) check drafting and payment services: this service allows the merchants to cash the checks tendered as payment immediately through the ACH process and get the fund verified and transferred quickly
								</li>
								<li>
									Gift card and loyalty programs: as the name suggests, these services allow merchants to offer gift card or loyalty services without having to handle in house
								</li>
								<li>
									Payment gateway services: these services provide payment gateways for merchants with heavy transaction volumes
								</li>	
								<li>
									Merchant cash advance services: these services provide merchants with the ability to offer cash advance options to their customers
								</li>	
								<li>
									Online transaction processing: these services allow merchant to process payment online without the need for a physical POS system setup
								</li>	
								<li>
									Point of sale (POS) systems: As the name suggests, this is a service that allows the merchant to set up a POS system to accept physical bank cards
								</li>
								<li>	
									Electronic benefits transfer programs, such as food stamps: these allows certain merchants that qualify to accept these forms of government-issue funds (such as supermarkets, etc.)
								</li>
							</ul>	
						  </p>
						  <p class="text-left" style="padding-top: 10px;">Merchant services typically require the setup of a merchant account with a payment acquirer either directly or through an ISO (Independent Sales Organisation) or Referral Partner (RP).</p> 

						  <p class="text-left" style="padding-top: 10px;">The exception to this is mPOS systems, which are mobile pin entry devices (PED) typically connect to a mobile phone through Bluetooth and then use the phone's WiFi or mobile data to connect with the banks. This system doesn't require a merchant account although the companies that offer this type of service will still have a relationship with an acquirer. Payments made through this method cost a lot more per transaction so are ideal for businesses that don't put through many card transactions.</p>
