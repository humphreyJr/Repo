							<p class="text-left">Here is another useful tidbit about credit card processing lingo from your team at SlashMyFees.</p> 

							<p class="text-left">Merchant Solutions also known as Merchant Services designate a broad category of financial services intended for use by businesses. In its most specific use, it usually refers to the service that enables a business to accept a transaction payment through some secure (encrypted) channel by use of the customer's credit card or debit card or NFC/RFID-enabled device.</p>

							<p class="text-left">More generally, the term includes the following in its use:</p>
				
							<ul class="text-left">
								<li>Credit and debit cards payment processing</li>
								<li>Check guarantee and check conversion services</li>
								<li>Automated Clearing House (ACH) check drafting and payment services</li>
								<li>Gift card and loyalty programs</li>
								<li>Payment gateway</li>
								<li>Merchant cash advances</li>
								<li>Online transaction processing</li>
								<li>Point of sale (POS) systems</li>
								<li>Electronic benefits transfer programs, such as food stamps</li>
							</ul>

							<p class="text-left">Merchant services typically require the set up with a merchant account with a payment acquirer either directly or through an Independent Sales Organisation (ISO) or Referral Partner such as Banks or B2B Service Companies.</p> 

							<p class="text-left">The exception to this is mPOS systems which are mobile pin entry devices (PED) typically connect to a mobile phone through Bluetooth and then use the phone's WiFi or mobile data to connect with the banks. These systems don't require a merchant account although the companies that offer this type of service will still have a relationship with an acquirer. However, your SlashMyFees team would like to warn you that payments made through this method cost a lot more per transaction so are ideal for businesses that don't put through many card transactions.</p>
