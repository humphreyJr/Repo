						<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
						<hr />
						<p style="font-size: 16px;">
							We started SlashMyFees because we saw the confusion, complexity, outrageous pricing, and poor standards of customer service that have become prevalent in the credit card processing industry.  To support the millions of entrepreneurs who work tirelessly to provide their services, products, as well as employment opportunities, we decided to provide transparency, savings, simplicity, and outstanding service.
